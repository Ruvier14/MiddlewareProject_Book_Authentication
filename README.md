# MiddlewareProject_Book_Authentication
Book Exchange Web Application
Overview

This is a Book Exchange web application designed to allow users to list, borrow, and trade books in a secure and efficient manner. The platform uses modern technologies such as Node.js, Express, JWT Authentication, and MongoDB to provide a seamless and scalable experience. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in backend development, user authentication, and API design.
Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code. The flow of data and interactions is outlined below


Components:

Users: End users who interact with the web application through browsers or clients.
Web Application: The front-end of the system which serves as the interface for users to interact with the platform.
Node.js HTTP App Server: The server that handles all incoming HTTP requests and serves the application.
Express Layer: The middleware layer in the Node.js server, which includes:
CORS Middleware: Ensures cross-origin resource sharing is handled properly.
JWT Authentication: Provides secure token-based authentication and authorization.
Controllers: Manage requests, interact with the database, and return appropriate responses.
REST API: The application’s API endpoints, structured to perform CRUD operations on resources (e.g., users, books).
MongoDB Atlas Collections: A cloud-based MongoDB service used to store user and book data.

Security Flow

The security of the application is ensured by implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. Here’s a high-level breakdown of the flow:
Client Request and Authentication Flow:

User submits login form:
        The client sends a POST request to the /login endpoint with user credentials.
        Example Request: POST /login

Authentication:
        The backend validates the user credentials. If valid, a JWT is generated.

JWT Token Issuance:
        Upon successful authentication, the server responds with a 200 OK status and sets a cookie (access token) containing the JWT token.
        Example Response:

        {
          "status": "success",
          "message": "Authentication successful",
          "access_token": "JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
        }

Subsequent Requests:
        For every subsequent request to a protected resource (e.g., viewing a book listing), the JWT is validated to ensure the user has the appropriate permissions.

 Accessing Protected Resources:
        The user is able to access protected API routes such as /books or /profile only if the JWT token in the request header is valid.

Features

User Authentication: Sign-up and login functionality with JWT-based authentication.
Book Exchange: Users can add books to the exchange, browse available books, and exchange books (borrow or trade).
Protected Routes: Secure API routes accessible only by authenticated users.
User Profile: View user-specific information, including their book exchange history.

Tech Stack

Node.js: Backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-hosted database to store user and book information.
JWT: Secure token-based authentication and authorization.
CORS Middleware: Cross-origin resource sharing to enable client-side interactions.
Bcrypt.js: For hashing user passwords securely.

API Endpoints

POST /login: User login, returns a JWT token upon successful authentication.
GET /books: Retrieve all available books (protected route).
POST /books: Add a new book to the exchange (protected route).
PUT /books/:id: Update an existing book's details (protected route).
DELETE /books/:id: Remove a book from the exchange (protected route).

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download it from nodejs.org.
MongoDB Atlas: Set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster for your database.
